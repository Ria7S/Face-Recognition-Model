# Face Recognition Model Using Tensorflow

Face recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame. This project uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for the task of face recognition. The LFW dataset is used to train and evaluate the model.

The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset is used for training and testing the model. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle and should be placed in the `archive/lfw-deepfunneled/lfw-deepfunneled` directory.
